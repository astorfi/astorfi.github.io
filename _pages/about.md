Welcome to my personal site! I’m **Amirsina Torfi**, an accomplished Machine Learning Engineer with over 8 years of experience, having worked on advanced AI projects at Meta, Nike, and Huma AI. I specialize in **Generative AI**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **deep learning model optimization**. My work has spanned various industries, including augmented reality, sports analytics, e-commerce personalization, and healthcare AI.

Currently, I lead innovative AI projects as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I develop state-of-the-art generative AI and computer vision systems that enhance user experience, optimize performance, and drive revenue growth. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, where my research focused on privacy-preserving techniques in deep learning for sensitive data applications.

In my free time, I share insights into machine learning and data science through my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/machine-learning-mindset), exploring practical techniques and the latest advancements in AI.
