#### **3. Problem**

Current AR/VR applications often suffer from low real-time segmentation accuracy, impacting the immersive experience. Even small segmentation errors or delays can disrupt user interactions, as AR/VR requires precise, real-time responses to visual data. This project aimed to significantly improve segmentation accuracy to enhance user engagement and satisfaction in AR/VR environments.

High segmentation accuracy is essential for creating engaging and immersive AR/VR experiences. Precise segmentation enhances the realism of virtual interactions, bridging the gap between digital and real-world environments. By achieving better segmentation accuracy, AR/VR applications become more interactive and enjoyable for users across various scenarios, from gaming to professional simulations.

#### **5. Solution Approach**

This project designed a robust solution using SWIN Vision Transformers within the UperNet framework, supported by optimization techniques to meet the needs of AR/VR applications.

**Core Model Architecture: SWIN + UperNet**
The model architecture was based on SWIN Vision Transformers as the backbone within the UperNet framework. Unlike traditional CNNs, SWIN Transformers use a hierarchical structure that divides images into patches processed with a shifted window attention mechanism, allowing efficient computation while capturing local and global features. This enhanced the model’s understanding of complex visual data in AR/VR.

UperNet was chosen for its multi-scale feature representation, using a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for feature fusion and a Pyramid Pooling Module (PPM) for global context extraction. Together, SWIN Transformers and UperNet generated detailed segmentation maps, improving accuracy and relevance in AR/VR settings.

**Pre-Training and Data Augmentation**
Since transformers require extensive data, SWIN was pre-trained on various datasets with self-supervised tasks like Masked Volume Inpainting and Contrastive Coding, helping the model learn generalized visual features. Additionally, data augmentations like AugMix and AR/VR-specific transformations (e.g., rotations, color shifts) increased model robustness by preparing it for varied lighting and environmental conditions in AR/VR.

**Advanced Optimization Techniques**
The following optimization methods were applied to meet AR/VR performance requirements:

- **Knowledge Distillation:** A teacher-student model setup trained a lightweight student model to replicate a larger teacher model, reducing latency while maintaining accuracy.
- **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):** By simulating 8-bit quantization during training, QAT enabled faster inference with minimal accuracy loss, meeting real-time AR/VR demands.
- **Adversarial Domain Adaptation:** A discriminator trained to distinguish between source (training) and target (real-world) domains helped the model learn domain-invariant features, improving robustness across AR/VR environments.

**Weak Supervision and Active Learning for Data Labeling**
To address limited labeled data, weak supervision was used to generate coarse annotations for important regions (e.g., eye areas vs. background). Active learning then selected high-uncertainty predictions for expert annotation, ensuring efficient and focused labeling to enhance model performance.

**Synthetic Data Generation with Diffusion Models**
Diffusion models generated synthetic data to further expand the labeled dataset. A diffusion-based U-Net trained on unlabeled images learned structural patterns and produced feature-rich representations. This data supported a series of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for pixel-wise segmentation, refining segmentation accuracy even with limited labeled data.

#### **6. Technical Implementation**

The project integrated SWIN Vision Transformers with UperNet, leveraging hierarchical feature extraction and multi-scale processing. Pre-training on augmented data with domain-specific transformations and fine-tuning with quantization-aware training enabled high performance in AR/VR.

Each optimization technique was implemented as follows:

- **Knowledge Distillation:** A high-capacity teacher model was distilled into a smaller student model to reduce latency without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Quantization-Aware Training:** Simulated 8-bit quantization during training to ensure the model maintained accuracy under quantization.
- **Adversarial Domain Adaptation:** Adversarial training reduced distribution differences, ensuring strong performance across varied AR/VR environments.

Latency was minimized with model quantization and efficiency-focused training, providing real-time segmentation without compromising quality.

The enhanced model achieved significant improvements in accuracy and latency. Quantitatively, the system saw a 7% increase in mIoU, reaching a score of 0.96—well above baseline models. This architecture provided both precision and real-time performance for AR/VR applications.

Qualitatively, users experienced a more immersive AR/VR experience, with smooth interactions and accurate segmentation. The model’s adaptability to different environments improved robustness across various AR/VR use cases.
