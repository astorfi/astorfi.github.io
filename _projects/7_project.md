#### **3. Problem**

Low-resource languages are vastly underrepresented in language models, which limits AI accessibility and effectiveness in regions with diverse linguistic needs. Developing robust language models for low-resource languages is challenging due to limited data, affecting the accuracy and usability of AI in real-world multilingual applications.

---

#### **4. Significance**

Addressing the gap in low-resource language support is essential to make AI more inclusive and accessible worldwide. Effective low-resource language models could drive significant advancements in applications such as translation, virtual assistance, and educational tools, particularly in underserved linguistic communities.

---

#### **5. Solution Approach**

To build a cross-lingual model capable of supporting low-resource languages, I fine-tuned a pre-trained multilingual transformer model using self-supervised and cross-lingual transfer techniques. Starting with a base model trained on high-resource languages, I applied masked language modeling (MLM) and sequence-to-sequence tasks to help the model learn contextual information without labeled data. 

**Cross-Lingual Alignment**: I implemented a cross-lingual alignment process, where the model aligned shared subword embeddings across languages, allowing low-resource languages to benefit from knowledge acquired from high-resource languages.

In addition to MLM, I employed **adversarial training** to align semantic spaces between high-resource and low-resource language data. This approach used a language discriminator to encourage the model to learn language-invariant representations, fostering better cross-lingual understanding. To handle domain shifts common in low-resource languages, I trained the model on a mix of synthetic and real data, using back-translation to generate synthetic low-resource language data.

#### **6. Technical Implementation**

Pre-trained models like **mBERT** and **XLM-R** were fine-tuned on a combination of high-resource and low-resource languages. Self-supervised techniques, such as MLM, were applied across multilingual corpora, and adversarial training ensured robust cross-lingual representations.

**Data**: Training data included both real and synthetic low-resource data generated through back-translation, supplemented with multilingual Wikipedia corpora. 

**Implementation of Cross-Lingual Alignment**: Cross-lingual alignment was integrated within the transformer architecture, ensuring that subword embeddings aligned across languages, enhancing the model’s capability to generalize across linguistic boundaries.

**Steps in the Workflow**:
1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: MLM helped the model learn contextual cues within multilingual data, strengthening understanding without labeled data.
2. **Adversarial Training**: A language discriminator was used to encourage language-invariant representations.
3. **Back-Translation**: Synthetic data was generated through back-translation to supplement real low-resource data.
4. **Cross-Lingual Alignment**: Aligned subword embeddings allowed high-resource knowledge transfer to low-resource languages.
